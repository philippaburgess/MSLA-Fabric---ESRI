# Fabric---ESRI 🚀 MSLA AI Project: Ecuador 2024 Fires

## 🌍 Opportunity: Pre-and-Post Fire Risk in Global Communities

### 🔥 Pre-Fire Risks
- Climate change, deforestation, and land use changes increase **wildfire frequency and intensity**.
- **2024 Ecuador Fires** burned **76,000+ hectares**, destroying forests, farmland, and infrastructure.
- Communities lack **AI-driven risk assessment tools** to prepare and mitigate damage.

### 🌍 Post-Fire Risks Can Be Even Greater
- **Landslides, erosion, and water contamination** create long-term hazards after the fire is out.
- Loss of forests and agricultural land disrupts **ecosystems, food supply, and economic stability**.
- Without post-fire risk planning, communities **struggle to rebuild safely and sustainably**.

### 💡 The Challenge
**How do we help communities manage wildfire risks before and after disaster strikes?**

## 💡 Solution: AI + GIS for Wildfire Risk & Resilience

### 🌍 Before the Fire: Predict & Prepare
- **AI-driven risk mapping** identifies high-risk wildfire zones.
- **GIS-powered community hardening strategies** protect forests, farmland & infrastructure.

### 🔥 After the Fire: Assess & Rebuild Safely
- **AI + GIS detect** landslides, erosion & water contamination risks.
- **Data-driven recovery plans** support agriculture, ecosystems & economic stability.

### 📌 Case Study: Ecuador Wildfires 2024
- **Analyzing 76,000+ hectares** of burned land to assess forest loss & agricultural impact.
- Identifying **communities at risk** of post-fire flooding & landslides due to erosion.
- Using **AI + GIS to map recovery priorities** for reforestation & infrastructure rebuilding.

🔹 **Scalable, accessible, and built for global communities facing climate-driven wildfire risks.**
